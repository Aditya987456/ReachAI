### Important concepts during building this project.
* state = backend storage → “keep everything safe for later.”

* emit = visible output → “show/send only the important part now.”




* map(callback) callback parameters

When you do:

array.map((item, index) => {})


The callback receives:

item → current element of array

index → position of the item (always starts from 0)
